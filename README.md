Tableau- Superstore data analysis. The dataset concerns the sales, profits and returns of a superstore. The aim of this assignment is to understand which products, regions, categories and customer segments the superstore giant should concern itself with.

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- In quantity sold, office supplies had the maximum sales.
- Cisco telepresence system was the most sold product.
- Marketig activities can be directed more towards months with less sales, reducing advertising costs. As Novemeber is the busiest month for B2C sals, advertising costs are the highest in this month.
